# Temporal-Demand-Forecasting-for-Taxi-Services_-A-Multi_Model_Comparison

This repository contains code and documentation for a demand forecasting project. The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate various machine learning models for forecasting demand in a given scenario. The project involves exploring different modeling approaches, making certain assumptions, addressing potential hurdles, and presenting the results for evaluation.

### Approach
The approach taken in this project involves the following key steps:
1.	Model Selection:
â€¢	Various machine learning models have been implemented to forecast demand, including linear regression, XGBoost, ARIMA, deep neural networks (DNN and LSTM), and random forest.
â€¢	Each model has unique strengths and is chosen based on its suitability for the specific characteristics of the demand forecasting task.
2.	Evaluation Metrics:
â€¢	The performance of each model is evaluated using common regression metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared, and Adjusted R-squared.
â€¢	These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the models' accuracy, capturing aspects of bias, precision, and overall explanatory power.
3.	Assumptions:
â€¢	Several assumptions have been made during the course of this project. Notable assumptions include the stationarity of the time series for ARIMA and the importance of features for ensemble methods like XGBoost and Random Forest.
4.	Hurdles:
â€¢	One significant hurdle encountered during the project was the impact of a power outage due to a cyclone in the coastal area. This led to delays in the execution of complex models.
â€¢	The assumption of data quality and the need for interpretability also presented challenges that were addressed in the project.
5.	Solution:
â€¢	To overcome the hurdles, communication was maintained with the recruiter to provide updates on the project's status and reasons for any delays.
â€¢	The code is structured to handle different models efficiently, making it easy to experiment with various approaches and compare results.
6.	Results:
â€¢	The results are presented in tabular form, showcasing the performance metrics for each model.
â€¢	Interpretation and selection of the best model are based on a thorough analysis of these metrics, considering the unique requirements of the demand forecasting task.

### Code Organization
The code is organized into modular components for each model, making it easy to understand, modify, and experiment with different approaches. The models directory contains implementations for linear regression, XGBoost, ARIMA, DNN, LSTM, and Random Forest. The evaluation_metrics module contains functions for calculating the evaluation metrics.
